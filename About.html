        <p>
          Eddie Crochet is a multi-talented, multi-genre musician, song
          crafter and model from Austin, TX. The beauty and richness of his
           voice and lyrics are surpassed only by his physically captivating
           presence. His southern roots and constantly varying eclectic taste
           in music come together as influence for his ever expanding musical
           act.
