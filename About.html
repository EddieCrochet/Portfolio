          Hi, I'm Eddie Crochet.
          Music and technology have always been my passion and so naturally after high school
          I headed to my nearest community college to study.Upon serveral years of study and self discovery I came to the conclusion
          that I wanted something more for my life and career.
        </p>
        <p>
          I discovered and began self teaching myself programming with
          HTML and CSS and after falling in love with the logic and creative
          energy that comes with programming I enrolled in Austoin Coding Academy
          and put my nose to the grind. I graduated in December 2019 and have been
          tutoring for the school ever since.
